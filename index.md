# Hi, I'm Ukaba Jimmy 👋

I'm a data Data Analyst/Scientist passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. With expertise in basic ETL pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load), machine learning, analytics, data visualization and web applications, I help organizations make data-driven decisions.

## Featured Projects

### [E-Commerce-End-to-End-Data-Analytics-Platform](https://github.com/jimmyukaba1234-prog/E-Commerce-End-to-End-Data-Analytics-Platform/blob/main/Ecommerce_intergration%20(2).ipynb)
End-to-end e-commerce data analytics platform built on large-scale customer, order, product, and review data. Features database design, ETL pipeline, data cleaning, analytics, visualization, churn & LTV modeling, automated reporting, and an interactive web app to drive data-informed business decisions.

*Tools:* SQL, Python, Plotly, RandomForestRegressor, RandomForestClassifier, Streamlit.

*Impact:* Enabled end-to-end visibility into customer behavior, churn risk, and revenue drivers by transforming raw e-commerce data into actionable insights, predictive models, and automated stakeholder reports through a deployed analytics platform.

### [Health-ETL-Pipeline-and-Analytics-with-Machine-learning](https://github.com/jimmyukaba1234-prog/Health-ETL-Pipeline-and-Analytics-with-Machine-learning)
This project is an end-to-end Global Health Analytics Web Application that transforms messy real-world health data into actionable insights through automated data cleaning, analytics, machine learning prediction, and automated reporting.

The system combines ETL pipelines, SQL analytics, machine learning, data visualization, and a deployed web interface to support data-driven decision-making for public health stakeholders.

*Tools:* SQL, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, ETL, Streamlit

*Impact:* Built a production-style health analytics platform that converts messy global health datasets into decision-ready insights through automated ETL, SQL analytics, machine learning predictions, and reporting. The system eliminates repetitive manual analysis, supports evidence-based public health planning, and delivers insights via an interactive web interface and automated PDF/email reports.

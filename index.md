### [Health-ETL-Pipeline-and-Analytics-with-Machine-learning](https://github.com/jimmyukaba1234-prog/Health-ETL-Pipeline-and-Analytics-with-Machine-learning)
This project is an end-to-end Global Health Analytics Web Application that transforms messy real-world health data into actionable insights. 

The system combines ETL pipelines, SQL analytics, machine learning, data visualization, and a deployed web interface to support data-driven decision-making for public health stakeholders.

*Tools:* SQL, Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, ETL, Streamlit

*Impact:*Built a production-style health analytics platform that transforms messy global health data into decision-ready insights using automated ETL, SQL analytics, and machine learning. The system reduces manual analysis, supports evidence-based public health planning, and delivers insights through an interactive web app and automated PDF/email reports.
